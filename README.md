# :honey_pot: FoodDiary
Personal Project

FoodDiary is an app that allow users to track their diet and build a healthier lifestyle. Users are able to sign-up with FoodDiary and start recording their daily calorie intake. The app consists of notes and log entries. Each note is used to save a particular food item along with its nutritional information, including total calories, carbohydrates, protein, and fat (all in grams). These notes can then be added to a log that is specific to the date. Each log will contain the total calorie intake of the user for the particular date. Users can then save this log and begin anew for a new day!

This app is not connected to a backend server, so the registered users are saved to an ArrayList that refreshes everytime the app runs. I just made this for fun to become more familiar with AndroidStudios! Hope you enjoy! :smiling_face_with_three_hearts: Additionally, credit to the following users for the images used in this application, I do not own them. :yellow_heart:
